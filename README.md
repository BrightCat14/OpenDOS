A minimal test operating system for learning and experimentation with low-level programming.

## Features

- Basic kernel with assembly/C components
- ATA driver
- Keyboard input handling
- Basic I/O operations
- String utilities

## Current Limitations

⚠️ **Early Development Stage**  
This is a test/experimental OS. Many core features are missing:
- No command shell/CLI implemented yet
- Limited hardware support
- No filesystem or persistent storage

## Building

Requirements:
- NASM (assembler)
- GCC
- LD

```bash
./build.sh
./run.sh  # (or use your preferred emulator)
```
