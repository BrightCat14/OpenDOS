# 🤝 Contributing to OpenDOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OpenDOS** — we’re building a hobby operating system, and *every contribution matters*, no matter how big or small! ❤️

## 👋 New to contributing?

We love new contributors!  
Whether you're fixing a typo, improving documentation, writing code, or just asking good questions — you're helping!  
Don't hesitate — we welcome first-time contributors and will do our best to support you.

## 🚀 How to contribute

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** your fork and create a new branch  
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-change
```
3. Make your changes
   > If you're adding new `.c` or `.asm` files, don’t forget to update `build.sh` so they are compiled.
4. Run the build script to make sure everything still works
```bash
./build.sh
```
5. Commit and **push** your changes
6. Open a **Pull Request**

That’s it! 🎉

## 🧠 Coding Guidelines

* Write code in **C (freestanding)** or **NASM (Intel syntax)**
* Use **4-space indentation**
* Please add **comments** to explain non-obvious parts of your code
  *(Small/trivial changes don't require comments in `src/`)*
* Keep things simple and readable — this is a learning-focused project

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

Found something weird? Let us know!

* Open an **Issue** on GitHub
* Please describe:

  * What happened
  * What you expected to happen
  * Steps to reproduce (if possible)
  * Your system/setup (OS, toolchain, etc.)
  * Any relevant output/logs

## 🙏 Thanks again!

OpenDOS is a community-driven project, and we’re excited to have you on board.
